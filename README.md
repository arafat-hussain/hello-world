# hello-world
store, share, collaborate and build. Simple.
This is my first Github account and honestly, I love every aspect of programming - being a part of a community and disucissing the ins and outs of my projects is FUN and something I look foward to. This is just a simple hello world account, but more of my code for websites using HTML and app development will be released.
